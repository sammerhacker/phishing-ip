Garena Free Fire &#8211; Everything You Need to Know About the Most Popular Mobile Battle Royale Game

What Is Garena Free Fire?
Originally released in September 2017 as a beta for Android and iOS, Free Fire arrived at a time when battle royales were still relatively new. In fact, the first beta of the game was released even before PUBG had landed on PC, the latter of which launched the entire genre into mainstream appeal. This rise in popularity of battle royales, coupled with the growing interest in mobile gaming, made Free Fire one of the most downloaded titles in the Play Store, a title that they still hold today, 3 years later.

Free Fire is developed by 111 Dots Studio using Unity 3D, an engine that is popular among indie developer studios since it’s free and has a wide variety of assets readily available for downloading.

          Classic: The standard BR experience where up to 50 players get to fight each other to see who’s the best.
Clash Squad: A versus game mode involving two teams of up to four players each where the objective is to defeat the enemy squad. The team who wins the most out of 7 rounds is the victor.

Big-Head: A fun team-deathmatch-style mode where every character has enlarged heads.
Of the modes mentioned above, the staples are Classic and Clash Squad. The others are only available on certain days, and are often replaced entirely by new game modes regularly.

It’s important to note here that both Classic and Clash Squad have ranked variants that feature an elaborate matchmaking system to pair players against others of similar skill ranks. As the player wins games, they will increase in ranking and will get matched with better players. At the end of t

        <p>Free Fire has wonderful and detailed 3D designs that draw out the most ideal experience for the player; Characters, maps, weapons, battle impacts and move that make Free Fire very realistic. Likewise, modern game shader innovation and breakthrough light technology give the island a lifelike feeling.  

The negative aspect of Free Fire is its average graphics. If you don’t have a high-end smartphone and you want to enjoy survival games, then go for Free Fire. But if you are thinking that Free Fire is an alternative of PUBG, then let me burst your bubble and tell you loud and clear that PUBG is unbeatable in survival genre and you have to make some compromises with Free Fire.
